Three in One:
	Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
Hints:
	#2: A stack is simply a data structure in which the most recently added elements are removed first.
	Can you simulate a single stack using an array?
	#12: We could simulate three stacks in an array by just allocating the first third of the array
	to the first stack, the second third to the second stack, and the final third to the third stack.
	One might be bigger than the others, though. Can we be more flexible?
	#38: If you want to allow for flexible divisions, you can shift stacks around. Can you ensure that
	all available capacity is used?
	#58: Try thinking of the array as circular, such that the end of the array "wraps around" to the
	start of the array.
